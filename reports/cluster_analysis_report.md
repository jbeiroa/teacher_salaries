# Evaluative Report on the Fragmentation of Argentine Teacher Salaries: A Geospatial and Fiscal Analysis of Cluster Dynamics (2014-2025)

## Fiscal Federalism and the End of the National Equalization Model

The Argentine educational system has transitioned from a period of relative centralized coordination to a state of extreme fiscal fragmentation, a process accelerated by the structural macroeconomic shocks of late 2023 and early 2024. Historically, the financing of the educational system was governed by the Law of Educational Financing and supported by the Fondo Nacional de Incentivo Docente (FONID), a national fund created in 1998 that provided a horizontal salary supplement to all teachers across the twenty-four jurisdictions. However, the discontinuation of this fund in February 2024 marked the end of an era, forcing provinces to absorb the cost of these transfers with local treasury funds or allow a direct nominal and real contraction of teacher incomes.

The resulting landscape is characterized by deep asymmetries where a teacher’s purchasing power is no longer determined by their professional qualifications or seniority, but by the fiscal health and political priorities of their specific province. To analyze this complexity, a K-Shape cluster analysis (K=6) was performed on normalized salary signals from 2017 to 2025. This methodology allows for the grouping of provinces not by their absolute salary levels, but by the behavior of their salary signals over time, identifying patterns of resilience, erosion, and volatility.

### Strategic Macroeconomic Overview

| Macroeconomic Variable | 2023 Performance | 2024-2025 Outlook | Strategic Impact on Education |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| National Inflation (IPC) | 211.4% | Triple-digit volatility | Systematic erosion of basic salary scales |
| FONID Transfer Status | Active | Discontinued (Feb 2024) | 7% to 20% impact on gross pocket salary |
| National Salary Floor | $250,000 | $500,000 (Stagnant) | Loss of floor relevance vs. regional costs |
| Transfer to Provinces | - | -84% Real decrease | Forced fiscal consolidation at local levels |

## Cluster 0: The Architecture of the Permanent Bonus and the Sawtooth Income Model

Cluster 0, comprising provinces like **Formosa** and **Santiago del Estero**, represents a specific fiscal strategy centered on non-remunerative, extraordinary interventions. Centroid 0 is characterized by a relatively flat signal for most of the year, interrupted by massive vertical spikes. This "sawtooth" pattern corresponds to the disbursement of the "Bono de Fin de Año" and other extraordinary sums that often double or triple the monthly take-home pay in December.

### The Santiago del Estero Paradigm and Monthly Poverty
Santiago del Estero serves as the quintessential example of Cluster 0. In December 2024, the province achieved the highest purchasing power for teachers in the country, but this was an artificial peak driven by a massive year-end bonus. In typical months, the provincial state salary remains among the lowest in the country. The provincial government utilizes its low debt levels and high dependency on federal coparticipation to inject liquidity through bonos rather than structural increases to the basic salary.

### Formosa and the Masking of the 2023 Devaluation
Formosa follows a similar trajectory, where the massive December 2023 devaluation was initially masked by a provincial bono. The underlying erosion of the base salary continues. Formosa assumed the cost of FONID but froze the values at December 2023 levels, meaning the real value was halved by inflation within six months.

## Cluster 1: Structural Erosion in the Productive Heartland

Cluster 1 represents the "Eroded Center," encompassing historically stable provinces such as **Santa Fe**, **Córdoba**, and **Entre Ríos**. The signal shows an "L-shaped" trajectory: a sharp, permanent step-down in real value after December 2023 with no subsequent recovery.

### The Fiscal Squeeze in Santa Fe and Córdoba
In these provinces, the decline is a direct consequence of the loss of educational priority within the provincial budget. In Córdoba, the budget for education was reduced by 31.4% in real terms, while teacher salaries fell by 23.8%.

### The situation in Entre Ríos
By late 2024, Entre Ríos presented the lowest power of purchase for teachers in the country. For a starting teacher, the pocket salary fell below the indigence line.

## Cluster 2: Buenos Aires and the Volatility of Extraordinary Sums

Cluster 2 (**Province of Buenos Aires - PBA**) is characterized by unique "shocks" in 2018 and 2021.

*   **2018 Peak:** Response to the currency devaluation using non-remunerative sums to prevent a total collapse during a year of 47% inflation.
*   **2021 Peak:** "Floor Raising Strategy" post-pandemic with massive retroactive payments and incorporation of items into the basic salary.

---

## Cluster 3: The Anatomy of a Structural Collapse

Cluster 3 (**Chubut**, **Tucumán**, and **San Luis**) is the "Structural Decline" group. 

### The San Luis Mystery
Historically an "educational oasis," San Luis recorded the single largest real salary drop in the nation in 2024 (44% inter-annual contraction) after shifting to an austerity model following the reduction in federal transfers.

## Cluster 4: Mid-West Volatility and the Non-Remunerative Item Trap

Cluster 4 (**La Pampa**, **San Juan**, **La Rioja**) is defined by high local variance and "Quincenitas" (non-remunerative sums paid mid-month). This creates a "flattened" salary ladder where seniority is rendered meaningless.

---

## Cluster 5: Resource Sovereignty and the Recovery Axis

Cluster 5 (**Neuquén**, **Santa Cruz**, **Tierra del Fuego**, and **CABA**) is the only group showing a positive slope in 2024.

*   **Oil Axis (Neuquén/Santa Cruz):** Resilience tied to "Resource Sovereignty" and dollarized export revenues (Vaca Muerta).
*   **CABA:** Resilience driven by a strong local tax base and services, allowing it to fully assume the cost of FONID.

## Synthesis: The Quality Trap and Professional Attrition

The Argentine teacher salary analysis reveals a country that has abandoned the principle of "equal pay for equal work." 

1.  **The Quality Trap:** Teachers in eroded clusters are forced into "double or triple shifts," leading to pedagogical fatigue and reduced quality.
2.  **Ladder Flattening:** The death of the educational career incentive as the gap between novice and senior teachers disappears.
3.  **Internal Migration:** Salary gaps of up to 300% are creating a surplus of labor in the South and a critical shortage in the Center/North.
